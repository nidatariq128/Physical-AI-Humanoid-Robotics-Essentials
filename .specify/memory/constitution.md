# AI-Assisted Book Creation Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy Through Primary Source Verification
Every factual, technical, historical, or statistical claim must be verified against primary or authoritative secondary sources. Unsupported claims are prohibited. All content must be traceable to verifiable sources to ensure scholarly integrity and reproducibility.

### Clarity for an Academic Computer Science Audience
Writing must assume familiarity with foundational computer science concepts. Terminology must be precise, consistent, and formally defined where required. Content must be accessible to readers with computer science backgrounds at the academic level, maintaining formal academic-technical tone throughout.

### Reproducibility
All claims, arguments, and conclusions must be traceable to verifiable sources. Readers must be able to independently validate claims using provided citations. Every assertion must be supported by documented evidence that allows for independent verification and replication of findings.

### Scholarly Rigor
Peer-reviewed literature is strongly preferred for all factual claims. Informal sources may only be used when no peer-reviewed alternative exists and must be clearly justified. Content must meet peer-review-level rigor and academic standards for credibility and reliability.

### Zero-Tolerance Plagiarism Policy
Complete prohibition of plagiarism in all forms. All generated text must be original and properly paraphrased. Direct quotations must be clearly marked and cited using proper APA format. All content must undergo plagiarism detection and manual review before acceptance.

### Citation Completeness
All factual claims must include proper citations following APA format. Inline citations and a complete references section are mandatory. At least 50% of all sources must be peer-reviewed journal articles or conference papers, with remaining sources limited to academic books, standards documents, or authoritative technical documentation.

## Standards and Requirements

### Writing Standards
Target Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 10–12. Sentences must be concise, formal, and logically structured. All content must be original, academically rigorous, and suitable for peer-review evaluation. Writing must demonstrate clarity, precision, and scholarly depth appropriate for computer science academia.

### Content Constraints
Total Word Count: 5,000–7,000 words. Minimum Number of Sources: 15. Final Output Format: PDF. Citations: Embedded, properly formatted APA citations throughout the text. Content must maintain academic rigor while meeting specified length requirements.

### Quality Assurance
All content must pass automated and manual plagiarism detection. Content must undergo independent fact-checking review. All claims must be verified and traceable to cited sources. Content must meet all formatting, citation, and readability requirements before project completion.

## Development Workflow

### Specification-First Approach
All content creation follows a strict specification-first workflow using Spec-Kit Plus methodology. Specifications must be complete and approved before implementation begins. All deliverables must align with approved specifications and constitutional principles.

### AI Assistance Governance
AI-generated content must comply with all constitutional principles and undergo human review for accuracy, appropriateness, and scholarly rigor. AI contributions must be clearly identified where required and validated against primary sources. Human oversight remains mandatory for all content decisions.

### Review and Approval Process
Content must undergo multi-stage review process including fact-checking, citation verification, plagiarism detection, and academic rigor assessment. Peer review by subject matter experts is required before final acceptance. All constitutional compliance must be verified before milestone completion.

## Governance

All project activities must comply with this constitution. Any content, process, or decision that violates constitutional principles must be rejected or revised until compliance is achieved. Amendments to this constitution require formal documentation and approval process. Continuous self-auditing for citation completeness, factual accuracy, and plagiarism is mandatory throughout the project lifecycle.

This constitution supersedes all other practices and guidelines within the project. All team members and AI assistance must operate within these constitutional bounds. Compliance verification must occur at each major milestone, with constitutional adherence being a prerequisite for project advancement.
