# Robot Hardware

## Computer for AI Robots

Use a powerful computer for AI robots.

### Computer Parts
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3070 or better
- **CPU**: Intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 7
- **Memory**: 32GB or more

## Small Robot Computers

Robots need small computers:

- **Jetson Nano**: Good for learning
- **Jetson Xavier**: Good for tasks
- **Jetson AGX**: Most powerful

## Robot Sensors

Robots use sensors:

- **Cameras**: See colors and distances
- **IMU**: Know which way is up
- **LiDAR**: Map with laser light

## Robot Types

Choose your robot:

- **Simulation**: Test in computer
- **Small Robot**: Good for learning
- **Full Robot**: For research

## Robot Lab

### Space
- Need 4m x 4m area
- Good power and internet

### Safety
- Emergency stop buttons

## Where to Run

### Cloud
- Less hardware to buy
- Need internet

### Local
- More control

## Cost

Plan your budget for:
- Initial hardware
- Maintenance

## Summary

Choose robot hardware based on your needs. Start with simulation.
