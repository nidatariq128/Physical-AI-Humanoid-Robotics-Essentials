# Capstone: Full System Integration

## Overview

The capstone module integrates all previously developed subsystems into a complete AI robotics system. This comprehensive system demonstrates the full potential of Physical AI by bridging digital intelligence with physical robotic capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

In this capstone module, you will learn to:
- Integrate all major subsystems into a cohesive system
- Execute sim-to-real transfer with performance degradation management
- Validate complete system functionality
- Complete the comprehensive capstone project

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have completed:
- Foundations module
- ROS 2 control system module
- Simulation module
- Perception and navigation module
- Vision-Language-Action systems module

## Module Structure

This module consists of:
1. System integration workflow
2. Sim-to-real transfer techniques
3. Performance degradation management
4. Complete capstone project implementation

## Summary

The capstone module represents the culmination of all your learning in this book. By completing this module, you will have built a complete AI robotics system capable of receiving natural language commands, perceiving its environment, navigating safely, and performing complex manipulation tasks.
