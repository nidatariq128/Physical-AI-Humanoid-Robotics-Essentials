# Architecture Quality Checklist: Docusaurus RAG Chatbot Integration

**Purpose**: Validate architecture plan completeness and quality before proceeding to task breakdown
**Created**: 2025-12-18
**Feature**: [Link to plan.md]

## Architecture Quality

- [x] All user requirements from feature description addressed
- [x] Technical approach is sound and follows best practices
- [x] Components have single, well-defined responsibilities
- [x] Component interfaces are clear and testable
- [x] Components have minimal coupling
- [x] Error handling built into component design
- [x] Data flow paths defined for primary use cases
- [x] Error states properly handled in data flow
- [x] Data transformation is explicit and traceable
- [x] Performance considerations addressed
- [x] APIs are consistent and intuitive
- [x] Error handling is part of interface contracts
- [x] Data schemas are well-defined and validated
- [x] Interfaces are versionable where appropriate

## Design Completeness

- [x] Architecture overview clearly describes system structure
- [x] All major components identified and designed
- [x] Component purposes and responsibilities clearly defined
- [x] Dependencies between components identified
- [x] Interface contracts fully specified
- [x] Data flow described for all major use cases
- [x] Implementation approach is phased and realistic
- [x] Risks identified with mitigation strategies
- [x] Testing strategy covers all levels (unit, integration, e2e)

## Feasibility & Constraints

- [x] Architecture respects all specified constraints
- [x] Solution is technically feasible with current stack
- [x] Performance requirements can be met
- [x] Security considerations addressed (CORS, etc.)
- [x] Architecture supports both local and deployed environments
- [x] Solution is lightweight as required
- [x] Non-goals are properly excluded from scope

## Implementation Readiness

- [x] Clear path from architecture to implementation tasks
- [x] Component boundaries enable parallel development
- [x] External dependencies clearly identified
- [x] Integration points with existing systems defined
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Architecture supports success criteria from spec

## Notes

- Architecture plan validated and ready for task breakdown phase
- All user requirements addressed in component design
- Risk mitigation strategies in place for major concerns
