## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation tasks for AI Robotics Book project. The tasks.md file contains 156 specific, actionable tasks organized across 11 phases following the user story priorities from the specification. Tasks include setup, foundational infrastructure, and implementation of all 6 user stories (AI Robotics Foundations, ROS 2, Simulation, Perception/Navigate, VLA, Sim-to-Real), plus hardware documentation, 13-week progression, and final quality assurance. All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. The implementation strategy prioritizes User Story 1 as MVP, with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown created with 156 actionable items for AI Robotics Book implementation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with comprehensive implementation tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation using the defined tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are well-structured by user story priority with proper dependencies and quality gates

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all tasks follow required format and align with specifications
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation with Phase 1 setup tasks
