# Multilingual Documentation Setup

## Status
✅ Created Urdu translations for key documentation files:
- `docs/ur/foundations/intro.md` - Introduction to AI Robotics in Urdu
- `docs/ur/foundations/terminology.md` - Terminology and System Models in Urdu
- `docs/ur/foundations/ai-turning-point.md` - AI Turning Point chapter in Urdu

## How to Access
Now you can access your documentation in Urdu at:
- http://localhost:3001/ur/docs/foundations/intro
- http://localhost:3001/ur/docs/foundations/terminology
- http://localhost:3001/ur/docs/foundations/ai-turning-point

## Next Steps
To fully translate your book, you need to create translated versions of all documentation files:

1. `docs/ur/ros2/` - ROS 2 Control System
2. `docs/ur/simulation/` - Simulation module
3. `docs/ur/perception/` - Perception and Navigation
4. `docs/ur/vla/` - Vision-Language-Action Systems
5. `docs/ur/capstone/` - Capstone Project
6. `docs/ur/hardware/` - Hardware module
7. `docs/ur/progression/` - Progression module
8. `docs/ur/bibliography/` - References

## For Arabic and Spanish
Similarly, create content in:
- `docs/ar/` for Arabic translations
- `docs/es/` for Spanish translations

## Verification
Your Docusaurus site should now properly show the "Page Not Found" error for untranslated pages, but show the correct content for the pages you've translated.
